# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
Naive Bayes Classifier for Supervised Learning Problems. The function returns: 1) The Likelihood and the Evidence probabilities. 2) The A Priori probability. 

The Classification is done by the prediction function with the trainned model and the test data. 

* Xdata = Dataset Attributes

* ydata = Dataset Target

* laplacian_correction = Aplies the Laplacian Correction to Avoid zero counting problems. The Default Value is True.

* Finnaly a prediction function - naive_bayes_prediction( ) - is also included.
